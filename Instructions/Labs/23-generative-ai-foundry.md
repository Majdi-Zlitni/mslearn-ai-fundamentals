# Explore generative AI in Azure AI Foundry portal

Generative AI describes a category of capabilities within AI that create content. People typically interact with generative AI that has been built into chat applications. In this exercise, you try out generative AI in Azure AI Foundry portal, Microsoft's platform for creating intelligent applications. 

## Create a project in Azure AI Foundry portal

1. In a browser tab, navigate to [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com?azure-portal=true).

1. Sign in with your account. 

1. On the Azure AI Foundry portal home page, select **Create a project**. In Azure AI Foundry, projects are containers that help organize your work.

1. On the *Create a project* pane, you will see a generated project name, which you can keep as-is. Depending on whether you have created a hub in the past, you will either see a list of *new* Azure resources to be created or a drop-down list of existing hubs. If you see the drop-down list of existing hubs, select *Create new hub*, create a unique name for your hub, and select *Next*.

> **Important**: You will need an Azure AI services resouce provisioned in a specific location to complete the rest of the lab.

1. In the same *Create a project* pane, select **Customize** and select one of the following **Locations**: East US, France Central, Korea Central, West Europe, or West US to complete the rest of the lab. Then select **create**. 

1. Take note of the resources that are created: 
- Azure AI services
- Azure AI hub
- Azure AI project
- Storage account
- Key vault
- Resource group  
 
1. After the resources are created, you will be brought to your project's *Overview* page. On the left-hand menu on the screen, select **Playgrounds**.
