# Analyze text in Azure AI Foundry portal

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of AI that deals with written and spoken language. You can use NLP to build solutions that extract semantic meaning from text or speech, or that formulate meaningful responses in natural language.

Azure AI Language service includes Text Analytics, with capabilities such as entity recognition, key phrase extraction, summarization, and sentiment analysis. For example, suppose the fictitious travel agent Margie's Travel encourages customers to submit reviews for hotel stays. You could use the Language service to identify key phrases, determine which reviews are positive and which are negative, or analyze the review text for mentions of known entities such as locations or people.

In this exercise, you will use Azure AI Language in Azure AI Foundry portal, Microsoft's platform for creating intelligent applications, to analyze hotel reviews. 

## Create a project in Azure AI Foundry portal

1. In a browser tab, navigate to [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com?azure-portal=true).

1. Sign in with your account. 

1. On the Azure AI Foundry portal home page, select **Create a project**. In Azure AI Foundry, projects are containers that help organize your work.  

    ![Screenshot of Azure AI Foundry home page with create a project selected.](./media/azure-ai-foundry-home-page.png)

1. On the *Create a project* pane, you will see a generated project name, which you can keep as-is. Depending on whether you have created a hub in the past, you will either see a list of *new* Azure resources to be created or a drop-down list of existing hubs. If you see the drop-down list of existing hubs, select *Create new hub*, create a unique name for your hub, and select *Next*.

> **Important**: You will need an Azure AI services resouce provisioned in a specific location to complete the rest of the lab.

1. In the same *Create a project* pane, select **Customize** and select one of the following **Locations**: East US, France Central, Korea Central, West Europe, or West US to complete the rest of the lab. Then select **create**. 

1. Take note of the resources that are created: 
- Azure AI services
- Azure AI hub
- Azure AI project
- Storage account
- Key vault
- Resource group  
 
1. After the resources are created, you will be brought to your project's *Overview* page. On the left-hand menu on the screen, select **AI Services**.
 
    ![Screenshot of the left-hand menu on the project screen with AI Services selected.](./media/azure-ai-foundry-ai-services.png)  

1. On the *AI Services* page, select the *Language + Translator* tile to try out Azure AI Language and Translator capabilities.

## Extract named entities with Azure AI Language in Azure AI Foundry portal

Let's use the named entity extraction functionality of Azure AI Language to identify types of information in reviews.

1. On the *Language + Translator* page, scroll down and select **Extract information** under *Explore Language capabilities*. Then select the **Extract named entities** tile.

1. In the **Try it out** section, select the **Try with your own** tab. Then, under *Enter your own text, upload a file, or use one of our sample texts*, copy and paste the following review:

    ```
    Tired hotel with poor service
    The Royal Hotel, London, United Kingdom
    5/6/2018
    This is an old hotel (has been around since 1950's) and the room furnishings are average - becoming a bit old now and require changing. The internet didn't work and had to come to one of their office rooms to check in for my flight home. The website says it's close to the British Museum, but it's too far to walk.
    ```

1. Select **Run**. Review the output. 

## Summarize text with Azure AI Language in Azure AI Foundry portal
 
1. On the left-hand menu on the screen, select **Playgroumds**.
 
    ![Screenshot of the left-hand menu on the project screen with playgrounds selected.](./media/azure-ai-foundry-playgrounds.png)  

1. On the *Playgrounds* page, select the *Language playground* tile to try out other Azure AI Language capabilities. Select the **Summarize text** tile.

1. Under *Sample*, copy and paste the following review:
    
    ```
    Very noisy and rooms are tiny
    The Lombard Hotel, San Francisco, USA
    9/5/2018
    Hotel is located on Lombard street which is a very busy SIX lane street directly off the Golden Gate Bridge. Traffic from early morning until late at night especially on weekends. Noise would not be so bad if rooms were better insulated but they are not. Had to put cotton balls in my ears to be able to sleep--was too tired to enjoy the city the next day. Rooms are TINY. I picked the room because it had two queen size beds--but the room barely had space to fit them. With family of four in the room it was tight. With all that said, rooms are clean and they've made an effort to update them. The hotel is in Marina district with lots of good places to eat, within walking distance to Presidio. May be good hotel for young stay-up-late adults on a budget
    ```

1. Select **Run**. Review the output. The *extractive summary* provides rank scores for salient sentences.   

## Clean up

If you donâ€™t intend to do more exercises, delete any resources that you no longer need. This avoids accruing any unnecessary costs.

1. Open the **Azure portal** at [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com) and select the resource group that contains the resources you created.

1. Select the resources and select **Delete** and then **Yes** to confirm. The resources are then deleted.
