> **Note**: This exercise assumes that you have a [personal Microsoft Account](https://signup.live.com) (such as an outlook.com account) with which you are signed into [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge/download) on your computer. If you have both a work account and a personal account, be sure to select your *personal* account in the account settings at the top left of Microsoft Edge.

    >**Note**: If you are already signed in, you will be prompted to continue with your **Work** or  **Personal** account. Select **Personal** and sign in. 

1. In the chat box at the bottom of the Copilot pane, enter following the prompt:

    ```prompt

    > **Note**: The specific response may vary.

    Hopefully, Copilot has provided some useful guidance. However if you have additional questions, you can just ask for more specific information.

1. Enter the following prompt:

    ```prompt
    How do I go about setting up a business in New York?
    ```

1. Review the response, which should contain some advice and links.
