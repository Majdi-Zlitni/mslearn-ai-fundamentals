# Explore generative AI with Microsoft Copilot

Generative AI describes a category of capabilities within AI that create original content. People typically interact with generative AI that has been built into chat applications. One popular example of such an application is Microsoft Copilot, an AI-powered productivity tool designed to enhance your work experience by providing real-time intelligence and assistance. 

In this exercise, you will use Microsoft Copilot to generate travel plans.

> **Note**: This exercise assumes that you have a [personal Microsoft Account](https://signup.live.com) (such as an outlook.com account) with which you are signed into [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge/download) on your computer. If you have both a work account and a personal account, be sure to select your *personal* account in the account settings at the top left of Microsoft Edge.

## Use Microsoft Copilot to generate travel plans

1. In Microsoft Edge, browse to [Microsoft Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com) at `https://copilot.microsoft.com`. Click on the **Sign in** button on the right hand side of the screen. Sign in using your personal Microsoft account - closing any welcome messages or offers that are displayed.

    >**Note**: If you are already signed in, you will be prompted to continue with your **Work** or  **Personal** account. Select **Personal** and sign in. 


>Consider the following ways you can improve the response a generative AI assistant provides:
> - Start with a specific goal for what you want the assistant to do
> - Provide a source to ground the response in a specific scope of information
> - Add context to maximize response appropriateness and relevance
> - Set clear expectations for the response
> - Iterate based on previous prompts and responses to refine the result

1. Let's start with a specific goal. In the chat box at the bottom of the Copilot pane, enter following the prompt:

    ```prompt
    Where are the 10 best places to visit in the world in April?
    ```

1. Review the response from Copilot, which should present a description of places to visit.
 
1. Let's iterate based on previous prompts and responses to refine the result.

1. Enter the following prompt:

    ```prompt
    Can you explain your reasoning for the top three places? 
    ```

1. Review the response, which should explain the reasoning.

1. Let's provide a source to ground the response in a specific scope of information. Download and extract this image of two people doing yoga. Select the "+" in the chat box and upload an image. Then enter the following prompt: 
    
    ```prompt
    Where can I do the activity in the photo in your top recommended destination? 
    ```

1. Review the response, which should provide options in the top recommended destination related to yoga. 

1. Enter the following prompt:

    ```prompt
    I will bring my young children. Can you show me three affordable attractions here?
    ```

1. Review the response. 

1. Enter the following prompt: 

    ```prompt
    Create an invitation for a trip here
    ```

1. Review the response. You may notice that some of the destinations are not part of the original list. This makes sense if you think about what is happening with text generation: the language model .. .. 

    > **Important**: The specific response may vary. The AI-generated response is based on information publicly on the Web. While it may be useful to help you understand the steps required to set up a business, it is not guaranteed to be 100% accurate and does not replace the need for professional advice!

1. When you are done, you can close the window.
